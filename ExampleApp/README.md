## DynamicSDKSwift Example App

This is a minimal SwiftUI + WKWebView app used to validate:

- MessageTransport / RequestChannel parity with Flutter SDK
- WebView <-> host JSON message passing

### Open in Xcode

Open `DynamicSDKExample.xcodeproj` and run on iOS.

> Note: The project is intentionally minimal and may need signing settings adjusted on first open.
